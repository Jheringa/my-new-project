# Recipe generator

## Summary 

An AI that creates custom recipes based on the users food preferences. The users can fill in a couple simple questions from different categories.
The output will be a recipe fitting to these conditions. This will be a fun way to generate personal fitting and "new" recipes every-time. 


## Background

Young people (students) often struggle with making the decision what to eat at night. Students do not have much spare time, the meal can't be too expensive or complicated to make.


## Data and AI techniques:

With an unsupervised learning the Ai can learn from the different recipes used in the community. By using the nearest neighbour the Ai can use the same or similar recipes to the likes of the different users.


## How it is used

The users can fill in a couple simple questions from different categories. The first question will be about allergies and diets and food dislikes. After that they choose the protein base of the meal this could be Rice, Pasta, Salad etc. The next question will be the weird and tricky question, they get asked to pick a color. This will output of the type of sauce. (For example red is made of tomato, green is pesto etc.) The output will be a recipe fitting to these conditions. This will be a fun way to generate personal fitting and "new" recipes every-time. 


## Challenges

The downfall of unsupervised learning is that combined with the nearest neighbour technique there is a chance you get the same recipes more often. The challenges for this could be that ingredients could differ in prices and in that way are the meal can get expensive. Another thing could be that when the user selects their dislikes you cancel out multiple options qua recipes. There has a massive database or community.


## What is next

I think it could be built into a community platform where people can adjust the recipes, give feedback and tips to others.
